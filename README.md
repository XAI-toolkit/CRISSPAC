# CRISSPAC

Coronary artery disease RIsk-stratification Syntax Score Predictive Algorithm Calculator

# Description

CRISSPAC is an open-source web-based platform for the prediction of the Syntax Score and the severity of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) providing a variety of data analytics and machine learning solutions presented via an-easy-to-use graphical interface environment. The development of CRISSPAC is based on a data-driven framework proposed by Mittas et al. (2021).

The full paper can be found here [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8804295/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8804295/)

The aim of the software is two-fold:

- to facilitate both retrospective and prospective objectives dedicated to the diagnosis of the complexity of CAD;
- to support open science principles through the public availability of the source code.

Our envision is to promote software extensibility and utilization towards accurate diagnosis, decision-making processes and personalized patient management and counselling activities.

# Installation

The development of the platform is based on the open-source statistical programming language R and the R shiny framework. Users will need to download R in order to use CRISSPAC and we suggest the use of RStudio. All required code can be found in this GitHub repository.

Required software

- R version (minimal version 4.1.1)
- Rstudio (minimal version 2021.09.0 Build 351) (optional)

# Input

The primary data sources are the Electronic Health Records (EHRs) collected during the GESS study (GESS trial, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03150680) after appropriate anonymization of personal information. More specifically, five types of EHRs (History, Entry, Biochemical, Complete Blood Count and Differential) related to seventy-two measured risk factors are stored into XLSX files constituting the main input of the platform. The full list of the input variables along with their short descriptions can be found in Appendix.

# Usage

To initiate CRISSPAC, simply run the file server.R from Rstudio (or RGUI). Minimal data are contained in the source code of the package. For more detailed examples please have a look at the journal publication.
